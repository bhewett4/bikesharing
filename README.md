# Bikesharing
##  Overview of the Analysis
Used Bikesharing trends in New York City in order to determine if something similar can be established in Des Moines, IA. Used Pandas to first convert data into a new data frame, making a conversion in the process. Created a Tableau story in order to show different visualizations of data comparing multiple different points.

Additionally, we could also analyze the distances ridden in order to best determine locations for different bike stations.
